*PTT UDP*
<br>
This application is used to transmit sound using UDP protocol media, a kind of PTT for IP-based communications
<br><br>
PTT UDP, is a means of instant communication commonly used in wireless cellular telephone services that uses a button to switch the device from voice transmission mode to voice reception mode. The operation of a telephone used in this manner is similar to the use of a "walkie talkie". PTT switches the phone from full duplex mode, where both parties can hear each other simultaneously, to half duplex mode, where only one party can talk at a time. Multiple parties to the conversation may also be included. The encoding used is PCM 16 Bit and a sample rate of 800
